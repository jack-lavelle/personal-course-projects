# personal-course-projects

**README**

These are projects that I have done on my own in either classes or my free time. I will take some time in the future to make them cleaner but some of these
were written as much as 2 years ago when I had just started learning Python. 

**Sudoku / sudoku-ta.py**

This was an exercise in AI, creating a bot that can solve sudoku puzzles.

**Connect Four / connectfour_ta.py**

This was also in AI, creating a bot to play against in Connect Four with difficulty corresponding to how many moves it can look ahead.

**Physics Research Analysis / python_field_angle_analysis_PHYS299.py**

This was an example of the type of data analysis / visualization I would do in my lab. 

**See++**

(temporary description below ... will overwrite this)

This was a course project I completed with my group where we created a language and compiler in Fall 2021 at Columbia in my Programming Languages and 
Translators class (known as PLT if you are cool). Called See++ (pun intended) it was a "complete" programming languages whose function was to be able to 
create "art" using an object oriented language (quotes on complete as you cannot really create a complete language in the course of a few months and nor would
I have considered what you (or I) could have created with it "art"). Still it was a great learning experience where we had inherited a default language from our
professor that functioned as a barebones implementation of a generic language (think you could only write a program to print strings or numbers) and from that
we were able to figure out how to create our language and implement what we wanted.

(again this is a temporary description and I will overwrite this to include multiple sections on what exactly I did and how)
